# Crop_Yield_Prediction
I am working on my final year thesis and research paper titled "A Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Crop Yield in Precision Agriculture". For this study, I reviewed a lot of research articles that discussed numerous soil factors that may be utilised to forecast crop yield output results. During my investigation, I discovered that Decision Tree and Random Forest regression are the best strategies for estimating crop production since they are both effective at dealing with outliers and missing variables. For my analysis, I obtained a dataset of characteristics such as rainfall, temperature, crop name, pesticide and yield from FAOSTAT and World Data Bank. I utilised six machine learning algorithms: Simple Linear Regression, K Means method, Stochastic Gradient, Stochastic Boosting, Decision Tree, and Random Forest method. DTR and RFR exceeded the results, with prediction accuracy of 92% and 95%, respectively. The initial hurdles were to alter and integrate these various datasets into an algorithm-compatible format. Preprocessing included one hot encoding, feature scaling, outlier identification, and backward removal (which proved pretty difficult). I used this model to forecast yield in an Indian dataset, and the results were likewise excellent. I also hope to employ IoT-collected datasets to enhance the project's usefulness and performance.
